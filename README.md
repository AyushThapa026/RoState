# Ro-State

Ro-State is a simple roblox lua state machine that I wrote to handle states.

## Description

When writing code that requires multiple states it can get both challenging and tedious to have to navigate around conditionals. It is ideal to have the right code running at the right time. State machines are one way to tackle this problem. With finite state machines there can only be one state at any given time. Utilizing a state machine can greatly simplify the flow of your code.
